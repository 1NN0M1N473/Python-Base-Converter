# Python-Base-Converter
Lightweight number base converter written in python 3 for on-the-fly calculations; also, I'm to lazy to google hex-to-decimal converter every time :)

Uses separate function for each conversion, accepts user input as a variable, converts it using int(variable, numberbase), then prints the result using bin(), oct(), or hex(), respectively.

Intend to improve the code and expand available bases in the future
